    //
    // Testing for the server was done manually. Each method within the pingball
    // board and gadget interface was tested using junit tests. The parser also
    // has its own testing suite. Therefore, this testing strategy only tests
    // the client-server connection, board joinings, and ball relocation (through
    // invisible walls and portals) via the server.
    // 
    // The following describes the manual testing strategy:
    // 
    // Single client play: 
    // Check boards run as expected (run same boards in phase 1 at the same time to compare): 
    //      -input file for board 
    //      -default board
    // 
    // Multiple client play: 
    // Make sure that client disconnected if: 
    //      -same board and same name used 
    //      -different board and same name used 
    // Make sure that client stays connected if: 
    //      -using same board as another client with different name 
    //      -different board with different name 
    // Check boards run as expected (run same boards in phase 1 at the same time 
    // to compare) for: 
    //      -2 clients 
    //      -2+ clients
    // 
    // Joining boards: 
    // Check for correct wall representation (correct name) after wall connection 
    //  AND correct wall reverts back to solid after disconnection (name no longer present): 
    //      -h Board1 Board2, disconnect Board1 
    //      -h Board2 Board1, disconnect Board1 
    //      -v Board1 Board2, disconnect Board1 
    //      -v Board2 Board1, disconnect Board1 
    //      -h Board1 Board2, v Board1 Board2 
    //      -v Board1 Board2, h Board1 Board2 
    //      -h Board1 Board2, v Board1 Board3, disconnect Board3 
    //      -v Board1 Board2, h Board1 Board3, disconnect Board2 
    // Check for ball removal and ball addition to new board with: 
    //      -1 ball hitting invisible wall 
    //      -2 balls hitting same invisible wall at same time 
    //      -2 balls hitting connected invisible walls in different boards at same time 
    //      -2 balls hitting not connected invisible walls in different boards at same time 
    // Check for no ball reallocation with: 
    //      -1 ball hitting wall that was invisible wall after connected board disconnects 
    //      -1 ball hitting wall that was never made an invisible wall
    //
    // Portals:
    // Check for ball removal and appearance at connected portal for:
    //      -1 ball hitting portal that is connected to a portal within the same board
    //      -1 ball hitting portal this is connected to a portal in a different board w/ no shared walls
    //      -1 ball hitting portal that is connected to a portal in a different board w/ shared walls
    //      -2 balls hitting 2 connected portals at same time
    //
